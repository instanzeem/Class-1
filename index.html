		<p>This resource begins with a general description of essay writing and moves to a discussion of common essay genres students may encounter across the curriculum. The four genres of essays (description, narration, exposition, and argumentation) are common paper assignments you may encounter in your writing classes.
		<br><br>
		Although these genres, also known as the modes of discourse, have been criticized by some composition scholars, the Purdue OWL recognizes the wide spread use of these genres and studentsâ€™ need to understand and produce these types of essays. We hope these resources will help.</p>

		April is the cruellest month, breeding
		Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
		Memory and desire, stirring
		Dull roots with spring rain.
		Winter kept us warm, covering
		Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
		A little life with dried tubers.<em><u>(TS-ELIOT)</u></em>

		<p><b>Essays</b> can be a rewarding and challenging type of writing and are often assigned either to be done in class, <i><b>which requires previous planning and practice (and a bit of creativity) on the part of the student</b></i>, or as homework, which likewise demands a certain amount of preparation. Many poorly crafted essays have been produced on account of a lack of <strong>preparation and confidence</strong>. However, students can avoid the discomfort often associated with essay writing by understanding some common genres.</p>
